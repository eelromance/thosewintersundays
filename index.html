      <h1>Those Winter Sundays</h1>
      <h2><span class="annotation a0 tip" data-tip="Robert Hayden's &quot;Those Winter Sundays&quot; was first published in 1962.
Hayden was born in 1913 and grew up in a poor area of Detroit called Paradise Valley. He was adopted by neighbors at two years old, when his mother couldn't afford to raise him.
The father of the family who adopted him is the poem's main focus. In 1976 Hayden was the first African-American to serve as Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress, and in 1997, a Columbia University Press survey ranked &quot;Those Winter Sundays&quot; the 266th most anthologized poem in English.">by Robert Hayden</span></h2>

      <p><span class="annotation a1 tip" data-tip="This unusual syntactical structure begins the poem and places the audience in Hayden's memory. From the first two words alone, we get a sense that this tireless routine is repeated day in and day out, Sundays included.
        The plural form indicates that the poem's events aren't describing one day in particular, but are a recounting of many others like it. Hayden's choice of focusing on  Sunday reveals details about the father. Getting up early on Sundays implies that they went to church, and according to the Poetry Foundation, Hayden's adoptive father was a strict Baptist.">Sundays too</span> my father got up early
      and put his clothes on in the <span class="annotation a2 tip" data-mode="above" data-tip="Every morning his father gets dressed in the darkness before the sun has risen. Imagine: only seeing black, putting on clothes in the chilly air. Hayden includes these details in two words, a synesthetic combination of darkness and temperature: &quot;blueblack cold&quot;.
This word choice contributes to the poem's effect when read out loud. The &quot;ck&quot; within &quot;black&quot;, &quot;cracked&quot;, &quot;ached&quot;, and &quot;chronic&quot;, gives the poem a harsh percussive timbre. Similar soundplay can be seen with &quot;weekday weather&quot; and &quot;banked fires blaze&quot;. The quality of these sounds illustrate a thematic detail: the coldness of the winter and harshness of the father.
">blueblack cold,</span></p>

      <p>then with cracked hands that ached
      from labor in the</p><p>weekday weather made banked fires blaze. <span class="annotation a4 tip" data-tip="This short statement at the end of this stanza marks a shift in tone. It's the poem's shortest sentence and interrupts the momentum of the one before it. It states quite plainly how the father works hard for his children and always goes unappreciated. He does so both out of necessity and for an unspoken love that lies beneath a cold severe exterior. The tone of the sentence hints at the guilt Hayden feels as he reflects on this fact years later. Another detail this stanza reveals is that his father was a manual laborer during the week.">No one ever thanked him.</span></p>

      <p>I’d wake and hear the cold <span class="annotation a5 tip" data-tip="Sonic imagery is used to describe what is heard as he wakes up. Could it be sound of  wood burning in the fire? Or the father chopping wood before the fire has been started? Is &quot;cold&quot; an adjective describing the sounds &quot;splintering&quot; and &quot;breaking&quot;? Or are &quot;splintering&quot; and &quot;breaking&quot; verbs that figuratively describe what is happening to the cold? Hayden's word choice creates ambiguity about the causing of the sounds, and their implied emotional effect. A crackling fire, or a house heating up, is comforting and nostalgic. On the other hand, the chopping of wood is aggressive and violent.
">splintering, breaking.</span></p>

      <p>When the rooms were warm, he’d call,
      and slowly I would rise and dress,
      fearing the <span class="annotation a5 tip" data-tip="Hayden had a tumultuous childhood at home, and this gives a small clue into the dynamic of life with his foster family. &quot;Chronic&quot; describes the domestic turmoil using pathological language, comparing it to a habitual disease. This portrays the anger that Hayden feared as a common occurrence among the members of his family, which Hayden refers to with &quot;that house&quot; and diverts any blame. Despite the rooms being warm, fear is what motivates him to respond to his father's calls. Hayden then dresses, not in the &quot;Blueblack cold&quot; thanks to his father's labor.">chronic angers of that house,</span></p>

    <div class="section" class="stanza" id="page_five">

      <p><span class="annotation a7 tip" data-tip="This type of morning was routine for Hayden at the time, so he spoke to him as usual, taking what his father provides for granted. He doesn't specify what would've been said during this moment, perhaps omitting dialogue here represents regret that nothing of importance was ever said. Looking back on this time, Hayden understands the sacrifices his father made. This is shown through the almost heroic connotation of &quot;drove out the cold&quot;. This takes on a tone of retrospective admiration for his father. As a grown man with his own family, he later relates to his father's burdens.">Speaking indifferently to him,</span>
      who had driven out the cold
      and <span class="annotation a8 tip" data-tip="The mention of shoe polish here is indicative of the early 20th century, when shoe polish brands like Shinola were fixtures of everyday American pop culture. This detail alludes to the family getting ready to leave the house for church in their Sunday best. It also represents another way his father's love manifested itself. The father polishing Hayden's shoes portrays the father's affection in contrast to his son's indifference, and is something that Hayden only came to appreciate as an older man. To a young boy, waking up early and wearing formal clothes is probably not something he'd do by choice.">polished my good shoes</span> as well.</p>

    <div class="section" class="stanza" id="page_six">

      <p>
      What did I know, <span class="annotation a9 tip" data-tip="The repetition in this final line rapidly shifts the tone from past to present as Hayden reflects on his youthful naïveté. &quot;What did I know&quot; it places emphasis on his childish ignorance, how could he know any better back then? This repeating phrase also build momentum leading into the poem's final words. The rhythm of this line evokes a sort of retrospective apology. You can picture him shaking his head at his past self, still feeling guilty, but then ultimately forgiving himself for what remained unspoken between him and his father. Perhaps Hayden implies that at the time, his father is all he knew of love.">what did I know</span>
      of <span class="annotation a10 tip" data-tip="The final thought of the poem is emblematic. The subtle repetition of sounds: &quot;of&quot; and &quot;office&quot;,&quot;love's&quot; and &quot;lonely&quot;, create a bittersweet melodic quality. Hayden emphasizes that his father's dedication was a labor of love, without the expectation anything in return. Furthermore, this kind of love can be painful, as the lack of appreciation made his father lonely. He compares this kind of love to a workplace, laborious and necessary. This commentary on love could extend beyond his relationship with his father too. The final rhetorical question implies that Hayden faced this kind of loneliness later in his life as well. Knowing better now, Hayden reconciles his feelings about those winter sundays spent with his father as a young boy.">love’s austere and lonely offices?</span></p>
